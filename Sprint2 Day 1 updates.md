https://github.com/ANTS-COIN/platform/issues/8#issue-684147527
A discussion about the differences between UX & UI to get all team members on board.

•	Earners empathy maps:
https://github.com/ANTS-COIN/platform/issues/9#issue-684158722
4 users were identified:
1.	Client (Phase II).
2.	Beginner earner: Min. knowledge and an urge to learn
3.	Intermediate earner: Intermediate knowledge level, either seeks incentives or to learn a new field.
4.	Expert earner: High level of knowledge and seeking incentives.
Each team member created an empathy map for each earner type and combined them together.

•	Developing empathy questions with users

•	Suggested ideas for UX (Brainstorming)
https://github.com/ANTS-COIN/platform/issues/10#issue-684179584

A discussion about challenges that may face earners and solutions to solve it.
Suggestions:
-	Create a mini-curse at the beginning of earner’s journey about self-learning.
-	Some earners might face a language barrier:
1.	Create a mini-course before starting the learning journey to get them acquainted with the terminology.
2.	Create a library of the common used terms.
3.	Add a highlighted part that appears when earners hover on the term to find the translation in Arabic.

 
 **Decisions:**
•	The plan was set with milestones.

 
 **Next Steps for Day 2:**
•	Combining empathy maps of intermediate & Expert earners.
•	Working on empathy questions which will be put in a survey to be distributed on potential earners via our contacts as Enactus.
•	If we have time, we can go for interviewing potential earners.
